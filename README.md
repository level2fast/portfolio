# Software Portfolio

Welcome to my software portfolio! This repository showcases projects that demonstrate my expertise in software development, problem-solving, and coding skills.

## üòÅ About Me
I'm a software/signal processing engineer specializing in C++, MATLAB, Flutter, and SAR signal processing. I enjoy tackling software architectural design problems, extracting information from i/q data, learning about image signal processing, and building mobile apps. I'm a laid back guy who enjoys coming up with new ideas and watching them come to life. It's my definition of fun üòÄ.

## üìÇ Projects

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **[People Detection Radar](https://github.com/level2fast/millimeter-wave-radar-system)**
